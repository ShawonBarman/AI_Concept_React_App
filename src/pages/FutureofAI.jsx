                <h2>What Lies Ahead for AI?</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence has rapidly evolved, but the journey is far from over. The future of AI promises further breakthroughs, transforming industries and society as we know it. Let's take a look at some of the exciting developments and challenges that AI will face in the coming decades.

                <div className="future-area">
                    <h3>1. AI and Automation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The automation of jobs is one of the most significant impacts of AI. As AI systems become more advanced, they will take over more repetitive and dangerous tasks, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and even service industries. However, this also raises concerns about the future of work and employment for humans, with discussions around upskilling and reskilling becoming more important.

                <div className="future-area">
                    <h3>2. AI Ethics and Regulation</h3>
                    <p>
                        As AI technologies advance, ethical concerns around data privacy, security, and potential bias in AI algorithms are gaining attention. Governments and institutions will likely need to regulate AI systems to ensure they are used responsibly and transparently. Establishing ethical guidelines will be crucial as AI plays a more integral role in decision-making processes.

                <div className="future-area">
                    <h3>3. Human-AI Collaboration</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rather than replacing humans, AI can enhance human capabilities. AI will likely evolve to be a tool for collaboration, aiding humans in complex decision-making, creativity, and scientific discoveries. This will result in hybrid teams, where humans and machines work together harmoniously.

                <div className="future-area">
                    <h3>4. AI in Healthcare</h3>
                    <p>
                        AI is already revolutionizing healthcare, but the future holds even more potential. AI could drive personalized medicine, predictive diagnostics, and even AI-driven surgery. These advancements will likely result in more accurate treatments and better patient outcomes, particularly as AI systems continue learning from vast amounts of medical data.

                <div className="future-area">
                    <h3>5. AI and General Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest goals in the field of AI is achieving General AIâ€”systems that can perform a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. While we are still a long way from achieving General AI, progress in machine learning, neural networks, and other AI techniques is bringing us closer to this monumental goal.
