                <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. It is an interdisciplinary field of science that uses computers and datasets to build systems that can solve problems, perform tasks, and exhibit intelligent behavior.

                <p>
                    The field of AI has grown significantly since its inception, moving from early theoretical concepts to practical implementations that now affect daily life. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and medical diagnostics, AI has broad implications in numerous industries.

                <h3>The History of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    The concept of AI dates back to ancient times, with philosophers and scientists speculating about intelligent machines. However, AI as we know it today began in the 20th century with the advent of computers.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1950s:</strong> AI as a field of study began, with the invention of the first neural networks and the concept of machine learning.</li>
                    <li><strong>1970s:</strong> AI research expanded, and we saw the first practical applications like expert systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>1990s-2000s:</strong> AI moved into everyday applications, with more powerful algorithms and the rise of data-driven systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>2010s to Present:</strong> AI technology has accelerated with advancements in deep learning, big data, and computational power.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is generally categorized into two main types: Narrow AI and General AI.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> This is the most common form of AI today, designed to perform specific tasks such as image recognition, language translation, or driving a car.</li>
                    <li><strong>General AI:</strong> A theoretical AI that can understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a broad range of tasks, mimicking human cognitive functions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>AI in Everyday Life</h3>
                <p>
                    AI is already a part of our everyday lives. Some examples include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa that can perform tasks based on voice commands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> AI-driven recommendation engines on platforms like Netflix and YouTube that suggest content based on your preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles:</strong> Self-driving cars that navigate streets using AI algorithms.</li>
                </ul>
