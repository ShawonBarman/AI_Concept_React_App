                <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines and computers to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and adapting to new situations. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Through AI, machines can process vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions or predictions. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and advanced medical diagnostics, AI is transforming industries and revolutionizing the way we live and work. Its potential continues to grow, promising innovations that could surpass human capabilities in many areas, enabling smarter automation, improved efficiencies, and even creating entirely new possibilities that were once thought to be exclusive to human intelligence.
